h1. Shipury

Shipury (Shipment + Mercury) is a Rails 2.3 plugin to provide shipping rates for
USPS, Fedex and UPS from locally stored rate tables. This provides a significant
speed increase for providing shipping quotes over the APIs.

Due to complexity for International rates, Shipury has a fallback to the API for
international rates at this time. Future support for international is planned.
